            Journey to AI Education
          </h3>
          <p>
            Riley's journey began when he had early access to GPT-3 models and immediately recognized that ChatGPT would be "the most viral piece of technology" he'd ever seen. This foresight led him to become one of the first educators to focus exclusively on practical AI applications.

            His rapid rise to prominence is remarkable: going from zero followers to 201,000 followers in just 45 days, accumulating over 30 million views in that period. Today, he's known as the #1 AI educator on TikTok with 8.7M likes and 616.8K followers.

            Mission & Philosophy
          </h3>
          <p>
            Riley's mission is "to educate people on how to use these AI tools that are either very cheap or free and use it to better communicate with the world digitally." He believes that AI should be accessible to everyone, not just the tech-savvy, and focuses on practical applications rather than theoretical concepts.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            His teaching philosophy centers around the concept of "Vibe Coding" - using AI to create applications without traditional coding knowledge. This approach has democratized app development and opened new possibilities for creators and entrepreneurs.
